        It is always best to discuss your coaching requirements one-to-one with one of our coaching staff but, with your birth date being <strong><%=  mydob %></strong>, we think you should start your coaching at Hampton in:

      <h3 class="minigreen">Mini-Tennis Green</h3>
      <img src="/img/cf_green_court.jpg" />
      <p>
        The best current fit for your tennis coaching and development is in the Mini-Tennis Green category (ages 8 and 9 years old). Hampton is an accredited Mini-Tennis centre and offers excellent coaching for everyone in this age group and beyond, encompasing all the LTA Mini-Tennis categories and through your teenage years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Green Mini-Tennis caters for the final Mini-Tennis age range before children move on to the Yellow category of the National Competition Framework (see sidebar). This third stage of Mini-Tennis is the transitional stage before full tennis. On a full size court with a slightly lower bouncing ball than is standard the players learn to apply their skills, technique and use tactics. They will compete individually as well as in teams matches. 
     </p>
      <p>
        Our coaching staff currently provide coaching sessions for each age group in the National Competition Framework, starting with the Tots Tennis (3-5 years old) age group. Check out the current coaching schedule for details of what courses are being run, when and what the charges are.
