        It is always best to discuss your coaching requirements one-to-one with one of our coaching staff but, with your birth date being <strong><%= mydob %></strong>, we think you should start your coaching at Hampton in:
      </p>
      <h3 class="minitots">Mini-Tennis Tots</h3>
      <p>
        As you are currently <%= myageinyears %> years old, the best current fit for your tennis coaching and development is in the Mini-Tennis Tots category (ages 3 to 5 years old). Hampton is an accredited Mini-Tennis centre and offers excellent coaching for everyone in this age group and beyond, encompasing all the LTA Mini-Tennis categories and through your teenage years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tots is for children aged 3 to 5 years old and enables them to learn the basics and how to enjoy the game through a series of fun activities, based on the fundamental areas of balance, co-ordination, agility, movement and racket and ball skills.
      </p>
      <p class="panel">
        As you are 5 years-old right now (and therefore at the top end of Mini-Tennis Tots), the club coach has discretion whether to recommend you join the Mini-Tennis Red category right now or later. If you feel you are capable of playing at the level required for Red Mini-Tennis (for a quick peak of what is involved, go to the Next Steps section on the right), then have a word with your coach about moving up to Mini-Tennis Red now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our coaching staff currently provide coaching sessions for each age group in the National Competition Framework, starting with the Tots Tennis (3-5 years old) age group. Check out the current coaching schedule for details of what courses are being run, when and what the charges are.
