		Friendly games are being organised for the 2002 season to run over the period 6 April to 14 September, 2002.&nbsp;
		In that period we hope to have finalised 20 games at home and away against a number of local clubs.&nbsp;
		We are keen that as many members as possible participate in these games, especially those members who do not normally play for the club league teams.&nbsp;
		These games are exactly what they say they are, "Friendly", and a good opportunity of meeting other tennis players from other clubs.&nbsp;
		All abilities take part and it really is a very pleasant way to spend a Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;
		Watch the web site and the club noticeboard for full details - confirmed details should be available by mid-March, 2002.
