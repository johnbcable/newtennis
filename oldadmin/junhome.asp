						Hi, the close-season is upon us with a vengeance! The club tournaments and the
						league matches wont start for another 3 months or so. So, what can you do&nbsp;
						<b>
							now
						</b>
						&nbsp;at the club in the meantime?
						<br>
						<br>
						The Coventry Lawn Tennis League (that Hampton's teams play in) is also well
						under way. With the re-organised league this year (no separate
						North and South leagues), competition for our teams has been that much fiercer.
						Check out the latests league positions for our teams by visiting the
						league's web site (by clicking on the picture below) and/or by regular checks
						of the club noticeboard.
