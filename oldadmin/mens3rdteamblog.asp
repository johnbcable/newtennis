				<p class="team">
					<span>Team:</span>Graham Hollway and Craig Gordon<br />Jonny Hunt and Matthew Hunt  
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					 Match v Warwick by the race course. Graham and Craig won their first match at a 
					canter 6-0 6-0 just as Matt and Jonny started their second set and a large hurdle 
					started to loom before them. Jonny playing like a 'Gelding' who had just had his 
					............ chopped off got slower and slower while Matt's topspin forehand was 
					thrashing around like a mare at stud. After what seemed like 2 hours they just 
					lost the championship tie break 7-10 a great effort,  but like the Grand National, 
					second is nowhere!!
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					Warwick racecourse could be viewed from the courts and the cheers of the crowd and 
					the sweating mares reminded us of what lay ahead. Within 25 mins Craig and Graham 
					had stuffed the opposition 6-1,6-0 and went and sat down on the Pavilion seats to 
					wait for the youngsters to finish off. At around 10pm two very weary Hampton players 
					having won 7-5 6-4.staggered off the courts. From our &quot;dug out&quot; it had been 
					very difficult to know if the boys had won or lost each game as their &quot;body&quot; 
					language never gave Graig and I a clue 'cos Jonny had had enough!! But Jonny and Matt 
					&quot;manned up&quot; and did the business, well done boys.
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					 We all went to a local pub where platefuls of chips were served. Jonny was like a new 
					man and made a big impression on their consumption. A beautiful evening ( as Al Murray 
					would say) playing a &quot;beautiful game&quot; it was fun.

				<p class="matchreport" style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin-top: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
					A special mention for Jonny, setting it in context, he had spent all morning in A&amp;E with 
					a fractured big toe. <br /><br />
					Doctors told him not to play sport for 4 weeks, but dosed up on pain killers and spray on 
					the big toe, he still turned out and won a rubber and only narrowly failed in the other 
					(I understand Matt played well!!) <br /><br />

					script! Mark played really well and very solid but unfortunately I didn't play so well in the 2nd 
					game as energy levels dipped! That'll teach me for having a heavy weekend! Ha! Sorry Mark - I'll 
					make it up to you in next match! Or it could have been Chris Barker on one of the other courts 
					shouting which put me off?!!!
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					Jonny and Andy played amazing tennis - serving strongly and hitting all their shots on the fast 
					Astro surface. In this league it is easy to be dragged down to opponents level of hacking and lobbing 
					but they stuck to game plan and blasted their way to 2 great wins. Best I've seen either of them play 
					all season.
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					Their first match was a tight one ending up winning on championship tie break 10-8. One of the funniest 
					and strangest things I have ever seen on a tennis court was Andy Frith serving at match point - 
					HE STOPPED AND PAUSED FOR A MOMENT, SHOOK HIS ARMS OUT, PUFFED OUT HIS CHEEKS AND THEN PROCEEDED TO SAY 
					I'M SORRY I AM REALLY NERVOUS TO THE OPPOSITION!!! Was hilarious and thank god he put in a heavy first 
					serve to seal the win otherwise he never would have lived that one down. Or he still might not live that 
					one down. Shall we call him 'Nervous Andy' from now on?! Sorry mate but had to be reported!!

					second set 3-6 but held it together to take the championship tiebreak 10-8. Our second match was more

					Graham &amp; Nigel got off to the same bad start as us in their 1st match being 4-1 down. But they also

				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					Steve &amp; Chester made their customary slow start unwinding from a tough day at the office ([We ARE talking

					[Lovin' the 1st team use of initials - well played. Ed.] haven't had a good 3rd set record this year and the

				<p class="matchreport">
					In the reverse rubbers, Steve &amp; Chester seemed to be making lighter work of the Warwick 1st pair as they 
					raced through the 1st set 6-2 and 4-2 up in the 2nd with the opposition looking ready to wave the white flag. 
					Not sure what went wrong then but the opposition turned it around to win the 2nd set on a tie break.

				<p class="matchreport">
					Jonny &amp; Steve were nicely relaxed after winning their first rubber and kept the momentum going

					After a great performance last week at Kenilworth, Jonny &amp; Steve failed to reach the same standard this 
					week with both rubbers very similar - comfortably winning the 1st set of each match, before "comfortably" 
					losing the the 2nd set (Jonny &amp; Steve a little frustrated by one of the opposition disappearing for 5 
					minutes at the end of the 1st set of the second match ruining the momentum!). Unfortunately, and unusually, 
					we then lost both 3rd set tie breaks. In the first, we came back from 3-8 to 8-8, prompting memories of a 
					famous come back at Leamington where we recovered from 4-9 to win, but it was not to be this time.
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					On the other court, Xander and Chester started badly in the first rubber but reached a better level of 
					performance in the second rubber against the LMRCA 1st pair, saving multiple match points before taking 
					the 2nd set on a tie break as darkness descended. Jonny &amp; Steve stood to watch the drama of the 3rd 
					set tie break but I'm not sure why as at this stage we couldn't see the balls! As you may have gathered, 
					to go with the poor conditions underfoot there were no floodlights...
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					It was a real lottery but Chester was adamant that he was not going to travel all the way back to Rugby 
					for a few points, so Chester &amp; Xander battled valiantly in the darkness only to go down narrowly in 
					the 3rd set tie break.
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					Fortunately the result was not important in terms of league position but always very frustrating to lose 
					any 3rd set tie break, let alone 3 of them on one night!
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					The other big downside is that the result virtually guarantees that LMRCA get promoted with us and we 
					will have to go back there again next year!!
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					However, to brighten up the evening we phoned Tony on the way home who gave us news of the 1st team's 
					4-0 win to secure the Premier Division Championship for the first time in the history of Hampton Tennis Club.
				</p>
				<p class="matchreport">
					An absolutely fantastic achievement - well done to you all!
