<h3>SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE UP TO THE AGE OF 18 YEARS</h3>
</DIV>
<h4><i><u>Doucment issued - May 2001</u></i></h4>
In view of the current legislation the following guidelines are set out to
ensure that, through relevant procedures and appropriate training, children
and young people taking part in activities within the Tennis Club do so in a
safe environment.
<br><br>
<b><i>Those working with children in tennis should:</i></b>
<br><br>
1. Be professional and maintain the highest standards of personal behaviour
at all times
<br><br>
2. Be aware of situations which can be misconstrued or manipulated by others
<br><br>
3. Be vigilant of how actions can be misinterpreted
<br><br>
4. Not appear to favour or show interest in one child more than another
<br><br>
5. Be very aware that physically handling a player, perhaps to help develop
a game skill such as backhand, can be misconstrued by an observer or even
the player
<br><br>
6. Never swear, use or respond to sexual innuendo
<br><br>
7. Design and use training methods and programmes which are totally
appropriate to the individual player
<br><br>
8. Ensure that - as far as possible - they are not alone when working with
young players on an individual basis
<br><br>
9. Conduct all dealings with children in a public environment in full view
of others, in order that all behaviour can be observed
<br><br>
10. Our tours/trips away, ensure that another adult is always present when
working with children
<br><br>
11. Report any concerns within the area of Child Protection in confidence
and without delay to the appointed representative within the Club
<br><br>
12. Never discuss an allegation or suspicion with another person, other than
the police, before either the appointed representative or a responsible
person has been contacted
<br><br>
13. When recording an allegation or suspicion, record information including
all relevant details
<br><br>
14. At no time make any comment to the media
<br><br>
<h4>Guidelines for Adults working with Children and Young People in Tennis</h4>
All adults working with young people within the Tennis Club should read this
document in conjunction with the Tennis Club's Policy Document. They should
also be aware of:
<br><br>
&#61623; The Children Act 1989
<br><br>
&#61623; Child Abuse and what it is
<br><br>
&#61623; The importance of their own behaviour
<br>
<h4>Child Abuse</h4>
Child Abuse is recognised in four different forms: physical, emotional,
neglect and sexual. The Children Act 1989 defines children as those under
16 years of age.
<br><br>
Physical Abuse is when the child suffers some form of physical injury which
is not the result of an accident. Examples could be recurrent bruising,
possibly in places where accidental injury would be unlikely. Injuries
could also be broken bones, burns or scalds. The child may be reluctant to
remove clothing when warm.
<br><br>
In sport some activities which lead to physical injury could be considered
abuse.
<br><br>
Emotional Abuse is the result of the child receiving little affection, and
can also arise when the child is continually made to feel inadequate by
remarks made by parents or other adults. Emotional abuse can be
characterised by a change in behaviour, or an inability to grow and thrive.
Speech may be affected and the child displays nervous behaviour. In tennis
the child could lose interest in playing or avoids situations such as
matches because of the verbal abuse which may follow.
<br><br>
Neglect shows by a child failing to attain levels of development expected
for the age. Neglect is long term and it is important to notice both
physical and behavioural signs. If a child is badly cared for they may lack
friends and arrive late for sessions with no sign of parental support.
<br><br>
Sexual abuse occurs when a child is involved in sexual behaviour against
their will and with adults using their relationship with the child for their
own sexual needs. This can involve physical interference or involving the
young person with pornographic material such as magazines or videos.
<br><br>
The child will often be threatened not to reveal what is happening. They
often feel responsible and find it difficult to reveal what has happened.
In many cases the information is not given until months or years later. The
indicators of sexual abuse may be physical in terms of pain and/or
behavioural. They may seem very sexually aware for the age or be afraid of
a particular adult.
<br><br>
In sport the patterns for abuse, particularly sexual abuse, are different
from those occurring within the family. The abuser is often a trusted and
influential person within the organisation, and they tend to use situations
where there are few checks. Abusers are often repeat offenders.
<br><br>
<h4>The responsibilities for those Working with Children in Tennis</h4>
<b><i>1. To recognise signs of abuse and take any necessary action to help the
child
</i></b><br><br>
Recognising abuse can be very difficult unless there are physical signs or
behavioural changes. However abuse can be suspected from something the
child says. It is important to be aware and vigilant but not to make
assumptions.
<br><br>
Sometimes the child may indicate they wish to talk. In this instance it is
important to follow a number of principles:
<br><br>
&#61623; The child must feel safe and you must be calm and honest
<br><br>
&#61623; The child is asking for help and it may have taken a great deal of
courage to ask for that help. However you must make it clear that you will
need to speak to other people for further help
<br><br>
&#61623; You must listen to what the child says. Do not prompt them. Use
open questions and record what has been said. Remember to record facts and
not opinions
<br><br>
You must then:
<br><br>
&#61623; Contact the nominated representative within the Club
<br><br>
&#61623; Contact the Coach Education Director of the LTA - Anne Pankhurst on 0207 381
7055 - Mobile 07971 141341
<br><br>
You may then be advised to contact Social Services or the Police in which
case specific procedures follow which ensure the child is protected as
necessary
<br><br>
<b><i>2. To ensure that your behaviour when working with children, cannot be
called in question and that you have read and understood the Tennis Club's
Policy Document
