			Ian Poole and his team of Sam Peace, Matt Tew, Nate Wiggin, Emma Shalley, Bel Chefri and Beth Starkey offer a full programme of high quality group and individual lessons to both adult and junior members. They also deliver tennis coaching and PE to local schools. Ian is an LTA coach tutor. The team believes that sport plays a vital role in the development of individuals and is committed to delivering programmes to meet the needs of every player. Coaching supports and encourages competitive play. At present there are over 150 children and 60 adults taking part in regular coaching sessions. The coaching programme works alongside the LTA’s coaching initiatives progressing from Mini Tennis for the very young, through to full court adult tennis as follows:
		</p>
		<h2 style="clear:both;">Junior Group Tennis Coaching</h2>
		<img id="minitennislogo" class="floatleft" src="Images/arielmt1.gif" width="142" height="120" alt="Ariel Mini-Tennis logo" />
		<h3>Tots Tennis (ages 3 - 5)</h3>
		<p>
			Coordination fun based activities introducing racket skills to develop the basic fundamentals.
		</p>
		<h3>Mini-Tennis (ages 5 to 10)</h3>
		<p>
			Mini Tennis has been developed to motivate children aged 5 - 10 years, through 3 graduating stages of tennis (red -> orange -> green) that are suitable for their age and ability.  Mini-Tennis now forms the initial part of the LTA National Competition Framework (see below for more details).
		</p>
        <a class="morelink" href="minitennis.asp">More on Mini-Tennis....</a>
		</p>
		<h3 style="clear: both;">Junior Tennis (ages 11 &amp; over)</h3>
		<p>
			This forms the final part of the LTA National Competition Framework (see below for more details). The juniors are grouped according to age and ability and work on technique and tactics for both singles and doubles play on full court with normal balls
		</p>
		<p>
			ocial events are organised for all age levels. Girls only groups are offered for primary school children.
		</p>
		<h2>Individual Development</h2>
		<p>
			Individual development plans can be designed around playing and coaching needs. Tournament schedules can be provided for performance players. Help can also be given with other areas of development, for example, Duke of Edinburgh awards and work experience. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Private (One-to-One) Lessons
		</h3>
		<p>
			Take the opportunity to get that extra attention on your game, maybe focusing on one or two aspects.  These sessions can be booked directly with your coach with up to a maximum of 4 people per lesson. Discounts are available if you book a block of lessons. 
		</p>

		<h2>Bad weather during coaching? No problem!</h2>
		<img id="badweather" class="boxright" border="0" src="Images/bad-weather.jpg">
		<p>
			We always do our best to play through all weather, but our main concern is always the safety and well-being of the children. 
			Coaching continues through all weather, and indoor activities will be organised by the coaches if the weather does not allow the 
			children to play safely outside on the courts. on these occasions the Squash Courts or Scout &amp; Guide Hut may be used or a game 
			of table tennis may be an option! However, please bring suitable waterproof clothing and a drink to all your lessons.
		</p>
		<h2 style="clear:both;">Junior Competitive Opportunities</h2>
		<p>
			All age groups from mini red through to Under 18’s are given a chance to play in regular internal leagues and friendly or competitive matches against other local clubs. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Within the club Junior Championships at all levels are held during the year and an <a href="juniors/tournaments.html">annual tournament</a> is organised for more advanced juniors. Please ask your coach to find out more about current events that may be of interest to you and your child
		</p>
		<h2>Mentoring / Coach Development</h2>
		<p>
			Ian works with Warwickshire LTA to tutor young coaches to give them the knowledge and experience needed to further their coaching careers. Obtaining a level 1 coaching certificate is great experience for anyone, especially a teenager. If you are interested please speak to Ian.
