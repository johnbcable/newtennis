The club is continually developing -		and <b>new members are always welcome</b>! The club welcomes players of all standards, for casual or match play.		Adults and juniors have access to the services of a professionally-qualified coach.	</p>	<p>We offer competitive subscription rates with special discounts for family memberships. Members can take part in a 		range of club competitions and social events. Our 3 mens and 3 ladies teams compete in the Coventry Lawn Tennis League.		We are also an accredited Mini-Tennis centre and place great emphasis on encouraging young children to play tennis.	</p>	<div id="overlayboxquote">		<img src="images/3balls.gif" alt="Grouped tennis balls" width="64" height="64" />		<p>			I would just like to take this opportunity to extend my appreciation to the many junior members 			of our club for taking			part in the various North Warwickshire Doubles competitions which have run during the			summer and are now approaching their finals stages. Thanks must also go to the parents, guardians and			helpers of these children to spend the time so that their charges can take part in this			friendly, competitive competition. It is vital that our young talent take part in these types			of events if the Hampton league teams are to maintain and improve their league positions in			the years to come.		</p>		<p>Steve Ray</p>	</div>	<p>We always welcome ideas for presentation and content on our web site.
