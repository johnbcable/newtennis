		<p style="clear: both;">
			Finals day for 2010 is Sunday April 11 and everyone is looking forward to a great contest (and good weather)!  France and Ireland 
			are the two teams battling it out, in a remarkable parallel to the sister competition that is the Six Nations Rugby. Lets review the 
			route to the final.

			<h2>France</h2>
			<p>
				These two teams played each other at the start of the MAXI-Tennis tournament (in January 2010) and it was a great
				contest, Ireland just edging it then by 11 points. France then didnt lose another match which took them 
				to a deserved second place in the league table.

			<h2>Ireland</h2>
			<p>
				The Ireland journey was a bit more up and down. After beating France in the initial match, Ireland promptly convincingly 
				lost their next match to a disciplined Italy performance before bouncing back in their third match with a convincing win over
				England, an even better win against Wales and a tighter win over Scotland to end up top of the league.

				Maxi-Tennis has been operating now since 2006 (with a one-year lay off while the new courts were being built)
				and seems to be able to attract otherwise absent members down to the club to take part in team-focussed 
				competitive tennis - at a COLD time of the year! Add it to your 
				post-Christmas exercise programme and enjoy the social side of the competition. The after-match food is always 
				worth sampling! Cheer on your team even if you are not playing - your support could be crucial for your teammates. 
				If you've enjoyed the tournament let me know and we'll try and run one again next year.<br /><br />
				Best of luck to France and Ireland for a good match on Sunday 11th April - Italy will be back!.

		<h2>Match Report</h2>
		<p>
			Well Sunday 11th April dawned with a beautiful start to the day. By 2.40pm, it had partially clouded over thus 
			allowing participants a bit of shade while they were running around.
		</p>
		<p>
			By approximately half-way through, there was still all to play for with France in the lead by 11 points. With 4 wins each, the main thing 
			between the teams was that when Ireland lost, they lost by an appreciable margin, but when France lost, in the main, they
			still managed to rack up the points. In the second half, France managed to take 7 of the remaining 10 matches, many of
			those again with large margins, so much so that Rob Yates in his match with Ian Poole didnt need to get any points at all - 
			but annoyingly (from an Ireland perspective) he still did losing 10-9 to Ian in the final match of this MAXI-Tennis finals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Full scores from the match are shown <a href="showmaxiresult.asp?thefile=maxifinals2010.htm">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was no awards ceremony on the day - although Steve Ray did pop a cork or two! Food was brilliant as always. Thanks 
			again to everyone who has been involved in the tournament this year - well played!
