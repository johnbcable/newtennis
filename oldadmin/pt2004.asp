			If you live in Hampton-in-Arden, Meriden, Balsall Common, Barston, Knowle or
			anywhere else near by, this is your chance to take advantage of the country's
			biggest and best annual sporting offer - to play tennis for free!
			<br>
			<br>
			Play Tennis 2004 is run by the Lawn Tennis Association and the campaign offers
			everyone, especially beginners, the opportunity to pick up a racket and play.
			As part of the campaign, Hampton-in-Arden Tennis Club is throwing open its
			doors on Saturday 1st May for free.
			<br>
			<br>
			It's open to players of all ages and abilities and youngsters are particularly
			welcome to come and experience the greatest game in the world. So why not give it a
			try?
			<br>
			<br>
			Hundreds of venues around the country are expected to take part and the LTA
			anticipate that more than 85,000 will have a hit, making it the UK's biggest
			participation event.
			<br>
			<br>
			Steve Ray, our Chairman, said: "The campaign has been designed to encourage
			people of all ages to go to their local tennis venue and pick up a racket. We
			want to show people that their local tennis club can be welcoming and friendly.
			We particularly hope that the campaign attracts children and adults to try
			their hand at tennis and become long-term members of our club."
