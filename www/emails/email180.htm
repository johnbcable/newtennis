			<p>				The Knowle Fun Run very much lives up to its name - it is a primarily social occasion where funds can be raised for a 				variety of charitable causes by being active. If you are not a runner, then all the more incentive for you to get out 				and particpiate - as a side benefit, you will probably attract good sponsorship as running is so unusual for you!<br /><br />				The course in recent years has been run over two circuits of two and a half miles each giving plenty of opportunity for rests and, if 				necessary, early bail out. The addede incentive this year is the extra sponsorship offered to Hampton Sports Club runners 				(see below) which will help immensely in bossting the amount of money we can donate top our chosen charities this year.			</p>			<p class="boxsignature">Karen Finch</p>		</div>		<div class="centered">
