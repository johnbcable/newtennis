These courses all run from week beginning 7 April to 			week beginning 14 July, excluding the half-term week (which is week beginning 26 May). This makes each course a 14-week 			course. Please note head coach Ian would appreciate all fees due for these summer term courses to be paid by the start of 			summer term. Also attached is a booking form got you to use when signing-up for these courses.		</p>		<p>			<strong>N.B.</strong><br />All juniors should stay in their existing groups unless Ian has discussed a change.  Juniors who 			already attend an invitation only squad do not need a further invitation to attend.		</p>	</div>  <!-- content -->	<div id="wrapperfooter" class="bordertop">		<p id="reminder">			Have a wonderful summer term!<br /><br />			Don't forget: Keep your eyes on your email's and the Tennis Club web&nbsp;<a href="http://hamptontennis.org.uk/eventlist.asp">Event Diary</a> 			for more events (when we list them!)		</p>		<p>			The next event at the Sports Club is the start of season tennis club quiz on Saturday 12 April from 7.30 pm.
