        It is always best to discuss your coaching requirements one-to-one with one of our coaching staff but, with your birth date being <strong><%= mydob %></strong>, we think you should start your coaching at Hampton in:
      </p>
      <h3 class="miniyellow">National Competiton Framework - Yellow Category</h3>
      <img src="/img/cf_yellow_court.jpg" />
      <p>
        The best current fit for your tennis coaching and development is in the Yellow category of the National Competition Framework (age 11 years and over). Hampton is an accredited Mini-Tennis centre and offers excellent coaching for everyone in this age group and beyond, encompasing all the LTA Mini-Tennis categories and through your teenage years.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage, you will be perfecting your game more so than learning basic techniques from scratch; you will almost cetrainly take part in the internal club tournaments (if you wish) and optionally take part in other inter-club and national competitions appropriate to your age and skill level. As you progress through teenage years, you may also be invited to play in the Singles Box leagues, for one of the Hampton league teams and take part in individual singles or doubles competitions such as are advertised in national magazines e.g. On The Ball.
    </p>
      <p>
        Our coaching staff currently provide coaching sessions for each age group in the National Competition Framework, starting with the Tots Tennis (3-5 years old) age group. Check out the current coaching schedule for details of what courses are being run, when and what the charges are. Your coaches can continue to provide development and gudiance for your tennis throughout your teenage years and beyond.
