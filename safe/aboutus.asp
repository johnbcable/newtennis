			<h2>Club of the Year!</h2>
			<img id="cotytrophy" src="images/trophy.jpg" alt="We did it!" width="85" height="120" />
			<p>
			We are extremely excited and 
			proud to announce that Hampton-in-Arden Tennis Club was 
			chosen as the Club of the Year by the Warwickshire 
			Lawn Tennis Association in 2007.&nbsp; As there are 70 tennis clubs in Warwickshire, 
			most of whom have more facilities than us,&nbsp;the win&nbsp;was no 
			mean feat! This was announced&nbsp;at&nbsp;an awards 
			ceremony sponsored by Jobson James&nbsp;which was held on 
			Friday 18 January, 2008 at the Botanical Gardens in Edgbaston.&nbsp; Apart from 
            receiving a&nbsp;beautiful&nbsp;glass engraved trophy we were also 
            presented with a &pound;1,000 cheque courtesy of the Bank of 
            Ireland. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We would like to thank everyone who has been involved in making Hampton such a 
            great tennis club - juniors, adults, tennis coaches, volunteers,&nbsp;parents of juniors, etc etc.
			This award is a credit to all concerned.
