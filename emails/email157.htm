			Cool jazz/ blues/funk band <b>funkydory</b> make a 
            welcome return to Hampton In Arden to kick start a return to live 
            blues music at the club. With a new album on the way, there'll be 
            new material as well as established favourites to savour. The 
            brain-child of guitarist Jules Fothergill and his wife Lorna Reilly 
            (lead vocals), the 5-piece band are completed with lead guitarist 
            Marc Le Guerranic, Hayden Doyle on drums and Ian Mauracio on bass. 
            If you haven't got into this band yet, then you may be able to snap 
            up a copy of their first album, &quot;Still&quot;, at the gig.

			Hailing from Georgia in the ex-USSR, Dr Ika became a favourite at 
            record label Blues Matters before teaming up with our very own Peter 
            Morris in a venture specialising in high quality amps and speaker 
            cabinets. Sporting a vast range of guitar styles from delicate 
            finger picking through to raucous, Jimi Hendrix covers, Dr Ika is a 
            consumate guitarist who any budding player could learn a thing or 
            two from!
