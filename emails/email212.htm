		<h3>Pre-Term Autumn Coaching Reminder</h3>
		<p>
			The new Autumn Term Coaching Programme for Juniors is attached.  These courses all run from week beginning 1 September to 
			week beginning 15 December, excluding the half-term week (which is week beginning 27 October). This makes each course a 15-week 
			course. Please note head coach Ian would appreciate all fees due for these autumn term courses to be paid by the start of the 
			autumn term. Also attached is a booking form for you to use when signing-up for these courses.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>N.B.</strong><br />All juniors should stay in their existing groups unless Ian has discussed a change.  Juniors who 
			already attend an invitation only squad do not need a further invitation to attend.
