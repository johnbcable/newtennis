					The new Summer 2009 Junior Coaching Programme is attached together with a booking form. 
					You can also find this <a href="http://hamptontennis.org.uk/coaching_schedule.asp">schedule</a> on the club web site for reference.
					These courses all run from <strong>week beginning 
					Monday 20 April to week beginning Monday 13 July, excluding the half-term week (which is week beginning 25 May)</strong>. Therefore the courses run for 
					12-weeks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="color: red;">Normal coaching times and venues as per this schedule will resume when the courts are completed .  
					<strong><u>Interim arrangements</u></strong> as used in the Spring term <strong><u>will continue</u></strong> in the mean time.</span>  We do not have 
					an exact date from the contractors as to when the new courts will be complete.  We will let you know as soon as we do.  Thank you for your patience 
					in this respect..
				</p>
				<p>
					Payment should be made by <u>at least one week before the commencement of the course</u>, please.  If payment 
					is not received by two weeks into the new course a slip requesting payment will be issued.  If payment is not received by the following week, 
					unfortunately the child may be asked to leave the programme.  We are sorry to have to take this approach, but debt collection takes up a 
					great deal of time.  It is also unfair to the majority of people who pay promptly. Thank you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tennis coaching at Hampton is very popular and places are limited so if you do not wish to join the programme, please let Ian know so that he 
					can allocate the place to someone else.  Thank you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please wear sports clothing and tennis shoes or non-marking soled trainers.  This type of sports gear is practical and comfortable.  Jeans are not, 
					so we would politely ask you not to wear them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong><u>N.B.</u></strong><br />
					All juniors should stay in their existing groups unless Ian has discussed a change. Juniors who already attend an invitation only squad do not 
					need a further invitation to attend.
