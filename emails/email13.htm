            <p><b>Following on from the club's successful entry into Mini-Tennis
            activities, we are pleased to announce that we shall be giving our
            youngsters the chance to take part in the Lawn tennis Association
            Mini Tennis Awards scheme.</b></p>
            <p><b>In common with swimming awards, these are <u>not</u> primarily
            a competitive device but rather a way of recognising and further
            developing each child's skills. Incorporated into existing junior
            coaching sessions, children will find them easy to understand and
            hopefully exciting and rewarding to undertake.</b></p>
            <p><b>For further information, come along to the above meeting and
            speak with members of the Junior Committee on the night.
            Alternatively, if you cannot make the meeting, contact Ro Eccleston (01675) 442913,
