		<h3>Pre-Term Autumn Coaching Reminder</h3>
		<p>
			The revised Autumn Term Coaching Programme for Juniors is attached.  These courses all run from week beginning 1 September to 
			week beginning 15 December, excluding the half-term week (which is week beginning 27 October). This makes each course a 15-week 
			course. Please note head coach Ian would appreciate all fees due for these autumn term courses to be paid by the start of the 
			autumn term. Also attached is a booking form for you to use when signing-up for these courses.
		</p>
		<p>
			The revised schedule has taken the opportunity to reorganise some of the group timings. These differ from the schedule previously circulated (on 12 July) as follows:<br /><br />
			<ol>
				<li>The Tots tennis group that previously ran on Thursday from 1630-1715 now runs on Wednesdays from 1600-1630,</li>
				<li>The Mini-Tennis Red 1 group that previously ran on Tuesday from 1630-1715 is now a Mini-Tennis Orange group,</li>
				<li>The Friday 1545-1630 Mini-Tennis Red 2 group is now a Mini-Tennis Red 3 group, and finally</li>
				<li>There will be an extra Mini-Tennis Green group running on Fridays from 1630-1715 which will run at the same time as the Mini-Tennis Orange session.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>N.B.</strong><br />All juniors should stay in their existing groups unless Ian has discussed a change.  Juniors who 
			already attend an invitation only squad do not need a further invitation to attend.
