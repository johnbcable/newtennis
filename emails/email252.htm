					Hope you all enjoyed <strong>Old Play</strong> at the Scout and Guide Hut on 28th February. The band did us proud with a storming set including both 
					established classics and up-to-date chart numbers that had everyone on their feet. Well done, lads, a great night was had by all. If you missed the 
					gig and have a chance to see <strong>Old Play</strong> in the future then take it - you won't be disappointed!

					Coming to the clubhouse at the end of March:

				<h1 style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Free At Last</h1>
				<h2>Saturday 28th March</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; text-align: center;">
					<strong>Free At Last</strong> are a one-stop shop for the music of Free, Bad Company and Paul Rodgers.<br />
				</p>
				<p style="clear:both;">
					<strong>Free at Last</strong> were formed in 1982 under the name Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam featured three of the current members, 
					Jak (guitar/vocals), Shane (guitar) and Mick (drums) until Dave joined on bass in 1994.<br />
  					Uncle Sam's set contained a few original songs plus covers by such classic acts as ZZ Top, Pat Travers and of course Free. 
  					All the guys in the band have always had a great passion for the music of
  					Free, so in 1996 when deciding to create a tribute there was only one choice who it would be. Since then they have gone from strength to strength 
  					headlining at Bill Flynn's Free Convention and playing many of the top venues around the country, universally agreed to be the best Free and 
  					Bad Company tribute around. With the original Bad Company reforming to promote their Anthology 2cd set, Paul Rodgers releasing solo albums 
  					and joining Queen as their singer for a world tour and an album, it only serves to prove sustained interest in what the band are trying to 
  					recreate.<br />
  				</p>
  				<p>
					So for a night of 70's style red hot blues influenced, soul stealing ROCK the choice must be <strong><span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">FREE AT LAST</span></strong>!
				</p>
