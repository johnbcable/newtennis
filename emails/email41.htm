                <p align="left"><b>Dear Member</b>,&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Do you need to buy wine for Christmas?&nbsp; Why not buy a case 
                through the tennis club wine offer?&nbsp; You can be assured of the 
                quality and you should find the wine&nbsp;no more expensive than 
                supermarket or wine club prices.&nbsp; In fact, in most instances it 
                should&nbsp;be cheaper.&nbsp; However, the great thing is that £10 per 
                case will be donated by the&nbsp;wine supplier to the Tennis Court 
                Redevelopement Fund.&nbsp; So please drink your way into supporting 
                the club!&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Like last year the supplier is <b>Brian Binns</b> who lives in 
                Loughborough. He is an&nbsp;independent wine dealer whose trade has 
                developed out of a personal love&nbsp;of wine. Running a small 
                business, Brian maintains a close eye on the&nbsp;wine quality 
                himself and keeps his overheads low. I have purchased 
                the&nbsp;majority of my wine through Brian for the last&nbsp;four years so 
                I can&nbsp;vouch for the quality of wines that he supplies. His 
                guarantee of&nbsp;quality means that he will replace a bottle if 
                there is a fault, although I have to say that personally I&nbsp;have 
                never had to return a bottle.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Here is what you should do:&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  <div align="left">
                    <b>Print</b> the wine list and decide what to buy. You 
                    have10 whites (inc one sparkling) and 10 reds to choose 
                    from. The only rule is&nbsp;that you must order in multiples of 
                    12 bottles&nbsp;to prevent things getting too complex.&nbsp; Each&nbsp;wine 
                    has to&nbsp;be ordered in 3's so if you order one case you would 
                    typically choose 4 different&nbsp;wines. &nbsp;Please remember that I 
                    am&nbsp;doing this to raise money for the Tennis Club and not to 
                    make any&nbsp;personal profit so I am trying to make life 
                    relatively easy.</div>

                top wineries. I am importing this blended white and a red 
                (listed later). This is a mélange of the up and coming variety 
                Colombard with the ubiquitous Chardonnay. These two grapes marry 
                beautifully. The wine is pale lemon in colour with a very fruity 
                nose of peardrops and citrus. The Colombard imparts crisp, green 
                fruit on the palate, balanced by citrus and buttery elements 
                from the Chardonnay. Overall, this is a very good wine, and one 
                which I will continue to stock. </span><b>

                wine is from their superior Crest range, which retails at around 
                £8. It combines two of the world’s classic white grapes, 
                Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, a blend which would be unheard 
                of in the Old World, and which only the Aussies would have the 
                courage to attempt. Not only do they try it, but also they 
                succeed superbly and it works so wonderfully well. The Melon and 
                Peach flavours of Chardonnay and the lifted tropical fruit of 
                the Sauvignon unite to produce a wine so full of flavour. There 
                has been no oak ageing; this is pure fruit flavours all the way 
                through, from the vibrant nose to the very long finish. </span>

                and good length. This superb Chardonnay is fruit driven with 
                peach and guava being dominant. The grapes were mainly sourced 
                from The Murray Valley together with other areas and the fruit 
                was chilled directly into a press avoiding skin contact to 
                maintain fresh fruit aromatics. All the wine is cold fermented 
                using selected yeast strains and 30% was put through a secondary 
                fermentation converting malic acid into lactic acid generating 
                extra complexity. Minimal oak was used in the making of this 
                wine and acts to give subtle cinnamon/vanillin andchar 
                overtones. As the wine has great depth of flavour and

                brand in New Zealand since 1990. Incidentally, for those golfers 
                amongst you, yes it is the same family as Frank Nobilo, a 
                notable New Zealand golfer of a few years ago. This wine is 
                their blended style, made predominately from well-ripened Muller 
                Thurgau and Muscat varieties from the Gisborne region. The wine 
                is made in an off-dry to medium style. The nose is citrus lemon 
                and lime, which follows through to the palate. There is a slight 
                pleasant prickle on the tongue giving a fresh dryness. The 
                middle palate shows rich, slightly sweeter fruit and culminates 
                with a long and aromatic finish. This is one of the nicest 
                medium priced white wines I have tasted this year. <b>The House

                Marlborough has long been regarded as <b><i>the</i></b> region 
                for “New World” Sauvignon Blanc; some would even say the best in 
                the whole world. Certainly, a wine such as Cloudy Bay commands a 
                price few of us would contemplate. However, discerning wine 
                drinkers are now distinguishing between the valleys that partly 
                make up the Marlborough region, with wines from the Awatere 
                Valley being regarded as of the highest quality.&nbsp; Nineteenth 
                Century settlers stopped in this valley at the point where they 
                were able to wade their horses across the Awatere River. They 
                called this point &quot;The Crossings&quot;. Today grazing land has been 
                replaced with vines, and the wine, especially the Sauvignon 
                Blanc, coming from The Crossings three vineyards opens up new 
                possibilities to enjoy flavours and textures that are different 
                on the palate, even from other vineyards in the same valley. The 
                grapes for the 2002 vintage were grown in Marlborough's Awatere 
                Valley on the estate’s vineyards. The blend is predominantly 
                comprised of fruit from their Brackenfield vineyard with a small 
                percentage coming from the Medway River Vineyard. The wine was 
                fermented using modern techniques and neutral yeasts to retain 
                as much fruit as possible. The wines from parcels of 
                individually harvested grapes were back-blended to give a wine 
                representative of the whole vineyard. Bottling was then carried 
                out after the wine had spent a couple of months on light lees 
                and was achieved with a minimum of filtering. This 2002 
                Sauvignon has a pale yellow colour with green highlights. Its 
                nose is characterised by a lovely mix of tangy lemon and herbal 
                notes. These run into a rich palate full of ripe currants and 
                honeysuckle, which rest on a lingering mineral base. At the time 
                of initial release from the winery, it was described as “A wine 
                which looks great now and will continue developing positively 
                throughout 2003-4”. After trying it, I feel it will continue to 
                drink well into 2005. <b>This wine has just been selected as the

                that this state of the art winery can produce. The colour is 
                golden yellow with green tinges and the nose has loads of 
                tropical fruit. This follows through to the palate with 
                pineapple, peach, guava and melon elements. The whole is wrapped 
                in lemony citrus tones. This is an unoaked fruity wine with a

                have bought enough (I hope) at a good price to last for a couple 
                of lists. This is young Sauvignon at its vibrant best; pale 
                lemon in colour with a fruity and floral nose. The palate is all 
                gooseberry fruit with flowery overtones, quite light but with a

                typifies clarets from this region; a further 12% Cabernet Franc 
                imparts elegance and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon gives body. The wine 
                is a deep garnet in colour with a nose of plum and berry fruit.

                McGuigan family commitment to the Australian wine industry began 
                almost 60 years ago when Perc McGuigan made many of Australia’s 
                greatest wines for Penfolds. Perc passed on the passion and 
                science of winemaking to his eldest son Brian who soon created 
                Wyndham Estate, which rapidly became one of the most famous 
                names in the Australian wine industry. This was due to Brian’s 
                winemaking skills and his wife Fay’s great export and marketing 
                ability. In 1992, after a multi-national conglomerate bought 
                Wyndham Estate, Brian and Fay started over again and McGuigan 
                Wines was born. The Black Label was the flagship range for 
                McGuigan and has continued to be one of the biggest selling 
                Australian wines. This wine, the initial one in the range, is a 
                superbly harmonious blend of Merlot, Shiraz and Grenache grapes 
                from the Murray Valley, which were harvested at the optimum 
                maturity level to produce a beautifully soft style of wine. The 
                colour is garnet red, the palate full of dark stoned and forest 
                fruit flavours with lifted chocolate and cherry aromas. There 
                are cinnamon spicy and peppery notes on the long finish. Quite

                California's finest sites for the cultivation of California’s

                steel tanks and then aged for approximately one year in American 
                oak. Sutter Home's 1998 Zinfandel displays a fresh brambleberry 
                aroma with pronounced black pepper spiciness. The bright, 
                medium-bodied, spicy raspberry flavours are rich and sappy, with

                detailed above I am switching to the “Vistamar” range of 
                inexpensive Chilean wines and am now in the position to stock 
                this Cabernet Sauvignon as I have nearly sold out of the similar 
                “Los Camachos” (see remainders section). Vistamar has 
                substantial hectarage in the Maipo and Casablanca valleys. This, 
                together with its large modern winery, gives Vistamar the scale 
                of production needed to supply in large volumes while 
                maintaining maximum quality. The colour is deep ruby with a nose 
                and palate of blackberry and blackcurrant with hints of 
                chocolate and coffee. There are no tannins; this is a very fresh 
                and fruity wine for drinking with or without meals. <b>I think 
                this range is better quality than the Los Camachos range it 
                replaces, and is very competitively priced at </b></span><b>
