			Hampton-in-Arden Tennis Club has hosted annual Play Tennis days for some years now and these have proved to be popular 
			and well attended. This year in particular we have lots to celebrate as our new courts will soon be complete and ready 
			for use. Bring family and friends; come and play some tennis, mini-squash and cricket and enjoy the afternoon. 
			There will be members of the club and its committees around during the afternoon to help with any questions you may have. 
			The basic layout of the afternoon is shown on the attached flyer.

			<span class="blueheading">Fancy helping out?</span><br />
			We will be serving tea and cakes during the afternoon.  If there are any budding cake bakers out there who would be kind enough to 
			make something tasty for the afternoon, we would be very grateful to hear from you.  Also, if you could spare some time to help 
			serve teas and coffees, we would be very pleased to hear from you too.  If you are able to help please reply to this email or 
			ring Jayne Barnes on .
