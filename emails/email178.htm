				REMINDER: British Tennis Initiative
			</h1>

		<p>
			You will recall that we sent you two previous emails in December to ask you to sign up for the new LTA British Tennis initiative. 
			If you have yet to do so please would you <a href="http://www.ltaorg.uk/Membership/MembershipReview">sign up</a> anyone in your 
			family who is a member of the tennis club, including children.
			There is no downside for you do this as it is free for 2008. Registration takes a minute or two and within 5 minutes the person 
			whose details appear on the form gets a confirmatory email back explaining more about the British Tennis initiative.  
			The link is:<br /><br />
			<a href="http://www.ltaorg.uk/Membership/MembershipReview">http://www.ltaorg.uk/Membership/MembershipReview</a>.<br /><br />
			Here is an extract from a letter we received from the LTA which explains the principles of the initiative:
		</p>
		<p class="bluetext">
			&quot;British Tennis membership includes a broad range of valuable benefits such as a player rating, membership card, advice from 
			professional coaches and top players, an e-newsletter, special members-only website content, information on competitions and events, 
			and you should have privileged entry to the British Tennis members-only Wimbledon ticket ballot.<br /><br />
			Joining British Tennis means becoming part of the British Tennis Family of 1 million-plus members. It means building a strong 
			foundation for a winning British game. It means being recognised for your contribution to tennis. It means supporting tennis from 
			the grass roots to Centre Court. We would encourage you to join now to become a part of the future of British Tennis.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			This membership and benefits are only free to members of affiliated clubs such as ours.
