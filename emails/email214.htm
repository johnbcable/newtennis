		<h3>Junior Members Social Tennis Session</h3><br />
		<p>
			We are holding a junior social session on Sunday 27 July from 4.30 pm to 6.00 pm.  This is for all junior members aged 12 to 18, who are capable of 
			full court rallying, plus any younger members who are specially invited.<br /><br />
			This will be run by our coach, Dave Mountford, but if successful, future sessions will be run by volunteers.  We would like to hear from any parents 
			who would be willing to go on a rota to help, please.<br /><br />
			So come along and enjoy some tennis!<br /><br />
			There is no charge for this event, but it is for members only.<br /><br />
