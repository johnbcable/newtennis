			The annual tournament organisers are ready to publish the draws for this year's annual torunament .... with the exception of the the above 
			competiton. This year more ladies than men have entered this competition. This is great news in one way as more and more of our ladies are 
			happy to take part in this competition, which usually turns out to be one of the most enjoyable of the tournament competitions both for 
			participants and for supporters. The following men have already bravely responded to the call and need not re-apply:

			D Betts,M Shalley,S White,S Farrant,P Thomas,G Hemington,M Joannides,P Roper,W Morris,D Margetts,C Barnes<br />

			The mixed doubles plate are not the uber-pairings of the main mixed doubles: this competition is for fun. All pairings are established so 
			that ANY pair in this competition could realistically win - there are no outright favourites. If you enjoyed the Maxi-Tennis (or if you missed that and 
			would like to take part in this more traditional format but fun competition) then please let Geoff (Redfern - 01675 442447) know if you wish to enter 
			as soon as possible. Finals day this year is to be held on <span class="blueheading">July 5th</span> so please remember to put your name forward only if you will be around 
			on that day .... and do it soon so the competition can commence!
