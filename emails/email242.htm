		<h3>Pre-Term Spring 2009 Coaching Reminder</h3>
		<p>
			The new Spring 2009 Junior Coaching Programme is attached.  These courses all run from week beginning 5 January to 
			week beginning 30 March, excluding the half-term week (which is week beginning 16 February). This makes each course a 12-week 
			course. Please note head coach Ian would appreciate all fees due for these spring term courses to be paid by the start of the 
			spring term. Also attached is a booking form for you to use when signing-up for these courses.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>N.B.</strong><br />All juniors should stay in their existing groups unless Ian has discussed a change.  Juniors who 
			already attend an invitation only squad do not need a further invitation to attend.
