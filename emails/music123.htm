  <h2 class="style2"><strong>Doctor's Orders</strong></h2>

  <p class="style4">To kick off, on <strong>31st January</strong> at the <strong>clubhouse</strong> we have blues band <strong>Doctor's Orders</strong> returning to the clubhouse.</p><span class=
  "style4"><img alt="Doctor's Orders in action" src="http://hamptontennis.org.uk/images/doctorsorders.jpg" width="489" height="228" style=

  <p class="style4"><strong><span class="style10">Doctors Orders</span></strong> have played at the clubhouse before and delivered a rollicking set of good-natured blues-rock drawing heavily from
  traditional blues sources while incorporating covers from artists such as ZZ Top, Wishbone Ash, Allman Brothers and Fleetwood Mac.</p>

    <p class="style4">On <strong>Saturday 28th February</strong> we have a fund-raising gig for our new tennis courts in the <strong>Scout and Guide Hut</strong> from local band <span class=

    before then you are in for a treat. They currently feature two "local lads" - Nigel Jones and Glyn Ryland - and perform a good set of covers and floor fillers. A good time will be had by all!</p>

  <h2 class="style8"><strong>Free At Last</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

  <p class="style4">And in March (<strong>Saturday 28th March</strong>) the clubhouse plays host to tribute band <strong>Free At Last</strong> who are a one-stop shop for the music of Free, Bad
  Company and Paul Rodgers. <strong><img alt="Free At Last in action" src="http://hamptontennis.org.uk/images/freeatlast.jpg" width="498" height="203" style="float: left; margin: 10px 20px 10px 0;"
  class="style1" /></strong></p>

  <p class="style4"><strong>Free at Last</strong> were formed in 1982 under the name Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam featured three of the current members, Jak (guitar/vocals), Shane (guitar) and Mick (drums)
  until Dave joined on bass in 1994.<br />
  Uncle Sam's set contained a few original songs plus covers by such classic acts as ZZ Top, Pat Travers and of course Free. All the guys in the band have always had a great passion for the music of
  Free, so in 1996 when deciding to create a tribute there was only one choice who it would be. Since then they have gone from strength to strength headlining at Bill Flynn's Free Convention and
  playing many of the top venues around the country, universally agreed to be the best Free and Bad Company tribute around. With the original Bad Company reforming to promote their Anthology 2cd set,
  Paul Rodgers releasing solo albums and joining Queen as their singer for a world tour, it only serves to prove sustained interest in what the band are trying to recreate.<br />
  So for a night of 70's style red hot blues influenced, soul stealing ROCK the choice must be <strong><span class="style10">FREE AT LAST</span></strong>!</p>

  <p><span class="style4">Tickets (<strong class="style7">p</strong></span><strong class="style7"><span class="style4">riced <b>&#163;10</b>)</span></strong> <span class="style4">will be available
  during February 2009 from the usual sources (<strong>Peter Morris 01675 442488</strong> and <strong>Jenny Roberts 01675</strong> <strong>443648</strong>) - first come, first
  served!<br /></span></p>
