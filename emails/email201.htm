		If you are a member of the Sports Club and wish to purchase a key fob to allow you access to the club house here is the process for you to follow:
		</p>
		<p>
		"All members may purchase a key fob to allow access to the clubhouse through the outer front door at any time of the day.  After 9:30pm the inner door will 
		be locked and you will need to ring the bell to gain entry. The bar staff will release the lock after checking on the video monitor behind the bar that it is 
		safe to do so.  If you find yourself leaving at a time when there is no one else in the clubhouse please remember to lock all doors and windows before you 
		leave so that security is not compromised.  If you are 14 or over you may purchase a key fob from the bar on Tuesday evenings between 6pm and 9pm at a cost of 
		£5 or alternatively have the key fob replaced free of charge in exchange for returning a faulty key fob.  If you lose your key fob please would your report 
		its loss to the bar on a Tuesday evening so that access to the clubhouse on that fob can be disabled to avoid compromising security."<br /><br />
