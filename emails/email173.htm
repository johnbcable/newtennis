			DOCTOR'S ORDER'S were formed in 2005 with the aim of playing good time bouncing blues, and the result is just that.
			Doctor's Orders' music, while it could broadly be described as blues, is an eclectic mix within that genre, combining 			funk, rock, r&b, jazz and swing to produce a varied, up-tempo set. Many of the covered artists are familiar, ZZ Top, 			Dr. Feelgood, Fleetwood Mac (of course), Johnny Winter, The Blues Band, Them, The Allman Brothers Band, (the inevitable) 			Gary Moore, Louis Jordan, Robben Ford and many more, but Doctor's Orders generally tend to avoid the more obvious "done 			to death" numbers in favour of songs which, although well known are perhaps not heard as often. The set includes a 			spattering of instrumentals featuring excellent guitar work from Jon Bridger and Martyn Davies which, while delivered 			with great flair and skill never fall into the trap of self-indulgence. The band is completed by the rock-solid rhythm 			section of Dave Wiggins on bass and Chris Houghton on drums.		</p>		<p class="centered">			<span class="blueheading" style="color:red;">TAKE YOUR MEDICINE!</span>		</p>
