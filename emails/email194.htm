		<p class="blueheading" style="text-align:center;">

			on SATURDAY &amp; SUNDAY 14th and 15th June, 2008

			Since setting the date for the Junior Tournament (initially on 14 June) we have been informed of the Solihull Schools Tennis Tournament 
			which takes place during the same weekend.  We would encourage juniors of the appropriate age to enter the schools tournament.  An entry 
			form and details are attached.  Please note that children who live in the area, but go to a school outside Solihull Borough may still enter.  
			In the case of query, please contact the tournament organiser, Ken Chalkley.<br /><br />
			In view of the Schools Tournament, we are not holding our own tournament on 14 June.  Instead it will be played in two sections:<br /><br />
			Boys and Girls Under 12 (as at 1st January 2008) - 1  pm Sunday 22 June 2008<br />
			Boys and Girls Under 16’s (as at 1st January 2008) -  1  pm Sunday 29 June 2008<br /><br />
			We apologise for any inconvenience caused but hope you will understand that we felt it best to avoid a clash of dates with another tournament 
			which our juniors may like to enter.<br /><br />
			The club mini tennis tournaments (scheduled for the 7th and 8th June, 2008) are unaffected by this change.<br /><br />
