			If you have not yet paid please would you help us by either:<br /><br />
			1) sending your subscription cheque made payable to "Hampton Sports Club" to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Barnes at 68 Meriden Road, Hampton B92 0BT, or <br /><br />
			2) replying to this email to let us know if you intend to resign your membership.

			Subscription rates are &pound;121 (26 or over), &pound;48 (18 to 25) or &pound;31 (7 to 17).  Under 7's free.

			A discount of &pound;5 per member is available if there is more than one tennis member in your house and a further 10% discount is 
			available if you are a member of another section of the Sports Club.  The prompt payment discount is no longer available.
