			<p>				We hope you had a very enjoyable Christmas and New Year, and are now ready to venture out on court again.			</p>			<img class="floatleft" src="http://hamptontennis.org.uk/images/tn_ian1.jpg" width="150" height="200" ALT="Our new tennis coach is ... Ian Poole" border="0" />
			<p>				All group coaching, both junior and adult, recommences from next <span class="blueheading">Monday, 7 January</span>.  This includes the 				adult daytime sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9.30 - 10.30 am.			</p>			<p>				For details of the junior coaching programme, please visit our website <a href="http://hamptontennis.org.uk/coaching_schedule.asp">here</a>.  				All the groups now have their own name rather than just a time.  This is to indicate what standard and age each group is aimed at.  				Some squads are invitation only.  However, if you already attend one of these groups an invitation will not be issued.  				The coach will invite any newcomers to attend.			</p>			<p>				If you have not already paid for your session(s) we would politely ask you to do so as soon as possible.  Chasing payment is very time 				consuming and is not a very pleasant task.  Thank you for your assistance with this.			</p>			<p>				For further information, please contact our Club Coach, Ian Poole on 07968 451956.
