				Everyone is invited to help us celebrate Hampton-in-Arden Tennis Club winning the Warwickshire Lawn Tennis Association 
				Club of the Year Award for 2007.  We are doing this by having a  &quot;Play Tennis&quot; open afternoon from 2pm on Saturday 3 May.
				The hockey club will also be offering junior hockey, free of charge, for the afternoon.  Further details are given in the 
				flyer for the day attached to this email.

			Hampton-in-Arden Tennis Club has hosted annual Play Tennis days for some years now and these have proved to be popular 
			and well attended. As you can see, this year in particular we have lots to celebrate. Bring family and friends; come and 
			play some tennis (even try your hand at the (in)famous frying pan challenge against the coaches) and enjoy the afternoon. 
			There will be members of the club and its committees around during the afternoon to help with any questions you may have. 
			The basic layout of the afternoon is shown on the attached flyer.

			<span class="blueheading">Fancy helping out?</span><br />
			We will be serving tea and cakes during the afternoon.  If there are any budding cake bakers out there who would be kind enough to 
			make something tasty for the afternoon, we would be very grateful to hear from you.  Also, if you could spare some time to help 
			serve teas and coffees, we would be very pleased to hear from you too.  If you are able to help please reply to this email or 
			ring Jayne Barnes on .
