				Some really great tennis was played by our juniors at the Orange Mini Tennis Tournament held on 8 June.  There were some really 
				competitive matches and it was a pleasure to see such young children really get to grips with the game.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Congratulations to all the juniors who entered and in particular to the winner, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Harry Goodworth</span> and to the runner-up, 
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">Elliot Morter</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to our coach, Ian (the biggest one in the photo), for running the competition and also to the older juniors who acted as scorers 
				(not an easy job!).   Finally, thanks to Georgie Stanley for providing the certificates and the refreshments and of course to the families 
				who came to support the children.
