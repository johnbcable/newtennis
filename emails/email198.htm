		<h2>UPDATE: 2008 Tournament Draw</h2>
		<h3></h3>

		<h3 class="centered"><span class="blueheading">Reminder - Play Matches On-Time</span></h3>
		<p>
		Please find attached the 2008 tournament draw including the results of matches played to date. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You will note that we have passed the deadline for playing last 16 matches in all tournaments 
		(note - there are no last 16 matches in the Veterans and Plate competitions).
		</p>
		<p>
		Please can you make an effort to play any outstanding last 16 matches this week in order to avoid 
		holding up the draw.  Any last 16 matches unplayed by Sunday 8th June are likely to result in a walk 
		over to the first named pair/person in unless you contact Geoff Redfern or Steve Ray to let them know 
		of progress in playing the match before that date.
		</p>
		<p>
		Thanks.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Tournament Committee
