		<p class="bordertop">
			Hi all past and present North Warwickshire contacts,<br /><br />
			Well the North Warwickshire Doubles League for 2008 is (or should be!) over by now - perhaps barring any appearance in a finals tussle for their age group. 
			How have your players done in their contests? 2008 was a changed 
			year for us all as our children have quite inexorably grown older and may consequently have moved to a different age band. If they have done this, they will 
			most likely be forming part of the youngest set of people in their group, whereas in 2007 they may well have been some of the eldest in their previous groups.<br /><br />
			It would be great to get some feedback from you all that we would share around the group - victories, losses, have the children enjoyed the experience, 
			have YOU as organisers enjoyed the experience and been given what you need to carry out that job.<br /><br />
			At the outset, there is work involved in making sure that your players get matches to play, turn up on time for them and have support during them so that 
			they can play their best and enjoy the competition. For all of that, the club is immensely grateful to you all for the time you have put in helping to 
			make Hampton's participation in this league as successful in all senses as it could be. The biggest thank you may well come from the players themselves 
			and the biggest thrill is watching them develop in skill and confidence in their game by taking part in a contest they enjoy!<br /><br />
			So, thank you all once again for your time and effort - hope to have you all back again next year!<br />
